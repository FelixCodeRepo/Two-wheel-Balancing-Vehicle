# Two-wheel-Balancing-Vehicle (Archived 2016)
This project is the first solution for preparation of National University Students' Smart Car Competition (NXP Cup)

Yao helps me in the hardware side, Diyang later came back to our team and we discarded this solution using two-wheel vehicle.

Later I modified it and add Bluetooth communication.
